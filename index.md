## Introduction

OceanGraph is a web platform for visualizing and analyzing Argo float oceanographic data. It offers interactive tools and profile information for researchers, students, and ocean enthusiasts.

Data is updated weekly, with approximately one week's worth of new data typically added every weekend. Updates and notifications about data availability are posted on X (Twitter) at [@OceanGraphJP](https://x.com/OceanGraphJP).

## Main features

### For everyone

- Search Argo floats worldwide by region and time (up to a 30-day date range)
- Search only profiles that include dissolved oxygen data
- Search by WMO ID for direct access to specific floats
- Track individual float trajectories
- Visualize time-series vertical sections of Argo float data

### For signed-in users

All free features, plus:

- Search Argo floats with an extended date range (up to 90 days)
- Visualize vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and oxygen
- View mixed layer depth from profile data
- View SOM (subsurface oxygen maximum) depth and its corresponding values
- Analyze T-S diagrams to explore water mass characteristics
- Download observation profile data for custom analysis
- Save screenshots of search results and visualizations
- Store up to 3 saved search conditions for repeated use (*)
- Bookmark up to 5 float profiles for later reference or comparison (*)
- Cluster Argo float profiles for pattern analysis
