## Ocean Basins

### Overview

The Ocean Basins feature provides time series visualization of average temperature and salinity changes across the world's major ocean basins. This tool displays long-term oceanographic trends using Argo float data from 1998 to the present.

### Ocean Basins Coverage

The analysis covers five major ocean basins: North Pacific, South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean. Each basin's data is analyzed separately to reveal regional trends.

### Data Visualization

#### Temperature and Salinity Graphs

The feature displays two main types of time series:

- **Average Temperature**: Long-term trends in ocean potential temperature by basin
- **Average Salinity**: Long-term trends in ocean absolute salinity by basin

#### Data Parameters

- **Temperature**: Potential temperature (Î¸) values at 10 dbar depth
- **Salinity**: Absolute salinity (SA) values at 10 dbar depth

#### Time Period

- **Coverage**: 1998 to present year
- **Data Source**: Argo float profile measurements interpolated using the Akima method
- **Temporal Resolution**: Annual

#### Profile Count Display

The visualization includes an additional bar chart showing:

- **Annual Profile Count**: Number of Argo profiles used each year for each basin

This profile count chart helps users understand data density and reliability over time.

### Applications

This tool is useful for:

- Understanding regional ocean climate variations
- Identifying long-term trends in ocean temperature and salinity
- Comparing oceanographic changes between different basins
- Educational purposes and oceanographic research
