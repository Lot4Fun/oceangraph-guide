# App Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information about using OceanGraph, understanding the data, and reviewing legal terms.

OceanGraph is a web application for searching and analyzing ocean observation data collected by the International Argo Program. You can search for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and other measurements from Argo floats based on geographic and temporal criteria, and explore the ocean state through various visualization and analysis features.

## What's in This Guide

### [Data Guide](./data_guide/index.md)

Understand the data behind OceanGraph:

- **Data Source**: Data obtained from the International Argo Program's Global Data Assembly Centre (GDAC)
- **Data Filtering Policy**: How quality-controlled, reliable profiles are selected (real-time and delayed-mode data, required variables, date and position quality checks)
- **Limitations**: Important considerations when interpreting data, such as missing values in vertical sections and sparse data due to quality control

Data is updated weekly, with approximately one week's worth of new data typically added every weekend. Updates are announced on X (Twitter) at [@OceanGraphJP](https://x.com/OceanGraphJP).

### [Usage Guide](./usage_guide/overview.md)

Learn how to use OceanGraph's main features:

- **Searching and Analyzing Argo Floats**: Search for float profiles using geographic bounds, date ranges, and data quality conditions, then perform analyses including trajectories, time series, vertical sections, T-S diagrams, clustering, mixed layer depth, and subsurface oxygen maximum
- **Exploring Analysis Results**: Browse and manage your saved analysis results using Visual Lab
- **Performing Custom Analysis**: Execute your own Python-based analyses using Analysis Lab
