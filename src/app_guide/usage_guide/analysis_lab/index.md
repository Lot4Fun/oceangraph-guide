This section provides tools for custom analysis of oceanographic data. These features allow you to work with your own datasets and perform specialized analyses beyond the standard search and visualization capabilities.

**Vertical Profiles** allows you to upload and visualize custom vertical profile data in JSON format. This tool enables you to compare multiple profiles of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, add annotations, and export charts for presentations or publications. Designed for researchers and students working with Argo-format oceanographic data.
