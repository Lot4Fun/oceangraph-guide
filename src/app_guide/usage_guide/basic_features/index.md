# Basic Features

This section provides detailed guides for the core features of OceanGraph. These features enable you to search, visualize, and analyze Argo float data effectively.

**Search and Bookmark** allows you to find Argo float profiles using geographic, temporal, and data quality criteria, and bookmark profiles for future reference.

**Trajectory and Time-Series Vertical Section** visualizes how oceanographic parameters change with depth and time along a float's trajectory, providing a comprehensive view of the water column structure throughout the float's journey.

**θ-S Diagram** helps you explore potential temperature-absolute salinity relationships of Argo float profiles in your search area, enabling identification of water masses and their characteristics.

**Clustering** uses machine learning to group Argo profiles based on their vertical structure. This experimental feature helps identify similar oceanographic conditions across multiple profiles.

**Mixed Layer Depth (MLD)** calculates the mixed layer depth from Argo float profiles using multiple oceanographic parameters (potential temperature, absolute salinity, and potential density) with the Gibbs SeaWater Oceanographic Toolbox.

**Subsurface Oxygen Maximum (SOM)** identifies and analyzes the subsurface oxygen maximum layer, which characterizes the vertical structure of dissolved oxygen, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions.
