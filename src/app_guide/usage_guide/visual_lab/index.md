# Visual Lab

This section contains advanced visualization tools for analyzing large-scale oceanographic trends and water mass characteristics using Argo float data.

**Ocean Basins** visualizes time series of average temperature and salinity changes across the world's major ocean basins (North Pacific, South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean) from 1998 to the present. This tool helps identify long-term oceanographic trends at regional scales.

**Mode Water Analysis** detects and analyzes mode water layers in Argo float profiles based on density, potential vorticity, and thickness criteria. This feature provides time series visualization of mode water thickness trends and seasonal distribution patterns.
