# Usage guide

This section guides you through OceanGraph's core functionality, from searching for Argo float data to visualizing and analyzing oceanographic observations.

OceanGraph provides three main workflows:

## [Basic Features](./basic_features/index.md)

Start by searching for Argo float profiles using geographic bounds, date ranges, and data quality filters. Once you've found profiles of interest, you can:

- View float trajectories and bookmark profiles for later analysis
- Generate time-series vertical sections showing how temperature, salinity, and other parameters evolve
- Create T-S diagrams to identify water masses
- Apply clustering analysis to group similar profiles
- Calculate mixed layer depth across multiple profiles
- Detect subsurface oxygen maximum layers

## [Visual Lab](./visual_lab/index.md)

Use Visual Lab to browse, organize, and revisit your saved analysis results. This feature helps you manage multiple analyses and compare results across different time periods or geographic regions.

## [Analysis Lab](./analysis_lab/index.md)

For advanced users, Analysis Lab provides a Python environment where you can write custom code to analyze Argo data. This allows you to perform specialized analyses beyond the built-in features.
